    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dish is a deli egg-bacon-and-cheese-on-a-roll 
        that has been pasta-fied, fancified, fetishized 
        and turned into an Italian tradition that, like many 
        inviolate Italian traditions, is actually far less 
        old than the Mayflower. Because America may have 
        contributed to its creation, carbonara is Exhibit A 
        in the back-and-forth between Italy and the United 
        States when it comes to food. Remember: the main goal
         is creaminess.</p>
    <p>it tastes pretty good</p>
